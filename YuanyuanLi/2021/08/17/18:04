“Drink water from your own cistern, 
running water from your own well. 
Should your springs overflow in the streets, 
your streams of water in the public squares? 
Let them be yours alone, 
never to be shared with strangers. 
May your fountain be blessed, 
and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth. 
A loving doe, a graceful deer— may her breasts satisfy you always, 
may you ever be intoxicated with her love. 
Why, my son, be intoxicated with another man’s wife? 
Why embrace the bosom of a wayward woman?”
‭‭Proverbs‬ ‭5:15-20‬ ‭NIV‬‬
